version 0.2, 2/19/2019:

	- added GFLToken class, deprecated
          GaeFlickrLib.auth_getToken_full; now instead of 2 methods
          that can return either a token as a string or a token with
          its metadata as a dict, we have an object that can be
          treated as either.


version 0.3, 2/20/2010:

	- implemented flickr.photos.getContactsPhotos

	- implemented flickr.photos.getContactsPublicPhotos

        - decorator for webapp.RequestHandlers to allow them to
          require a Flickr auth (and automatically creating a
          GaeFlickrLib object when an auth session exists)

        - drop-in callback handler that converts frob to token and
          starts a session for above-mentioned decorated request
          handlers.
