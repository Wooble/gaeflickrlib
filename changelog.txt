version 0.2, 2/19/2019:

	- added GFLToken class, deprecated
          GaeFlickrLib.auth_getToken_full; now instead of 2 methods
          that can return either a token as a string or a token with
          its metadata as a dict, we have an object that can be
          treated as either.


version 0.3, 2/20/2010:

	- implemented flickr.photos.getContactsPhotos

	- implemented flickr.photos.getContactsPublicPhotos
